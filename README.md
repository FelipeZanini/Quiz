# __Quiz__

Quiz is a site built for restless minds who always want to discover more fun facts about human knowledge, going through diverse topics such as science, history, geography and pop culture. 
The Quiz is intended to have fun questions but is also challenging, being composed of ten questions and four possible answers, presenting a feedback with the user score at the end of the quiz. Quiz is a fully responsive JavaScript website, easily navigated and user-friendly.

### Features Left to Implement
- Would be a good idea to implement a note with a straightforward explanation about the answer.  
- The Quiz also could have in the game over page a clickable list with all questions, so the user could check their answers.
- Would be great to have a timer implemented to the quiz, making the quiz more dynamic.

## Testing
-   I conducted many tests from a diverse range of width devices, and the site is very responsive, working perfectly fine with different devices such as tablets, smartphones and computers, a problem that I  faced was displaying the land and the game over page, however, the best way I found was to hide the quiz main elements such as questions, counter, answers, and show only the static pages, and after the user clicks on the start or restart button,  the static page is hidden, it is also worth mentioning the function that locks attempts at one and shows the right question for the user, finally let's talk about the next button that is hidden and shown depending on whether the user answered the question or not.

## Validator Testing
- No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) validator.
- No errors were found when passing through the official [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) validator

# Deployment
> The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps are:
> In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
> From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
> Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
